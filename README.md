What you will find
- Three complete agent implementations that run the same stock analysis workflow.
- A unified interface for comparing outputs and rationale.
- Scripts for running experiments and collecting metrics.
- Example notebooks with plots and sample runs.
- CI-ready tests and simple benchmark harness.

Why compare these frameworks
- You can study how different agent frameworks handle state, memory, and tool use.
- You can compare orchestration styles: central orchestrator, decentralized peers, and hybrid pipelines.
- You can test how each framework constructs reasoning chains, manages history, and composes tools.
- You can explore multi-agent design patterns in a concrete finance use case.

High-level design
- Goal: produce a BUY / SELL / HOLD recommendation and a short rationale for a given stock ticker and horizon.
- Inputs: ticker symbol, analysis horizon (short/medium/long), and optional market context (e.g., sector, index).
- Shared steps:
  1. Fetch market data and fundamentals.
  2. Compute indicators and signals.
  3. Run model-based reasoning combined with rules.
  4. Produce a recommendation and a concise rationale.
- Output: JSON record with recommendation, score, confidence, rationale, and diagnostics.

Key components
- Data fetcher: pulls price and fundamental data.
- Feature extractor: computes indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI).
- Signal synthesizer: aggregates indicators by rule.
- LLM agent: reasons over signals and context to form a recommendation.
- Comparator: collects outputs from all frameworks and scores their agreement.

Design goals
- Keep the workflow identical across frameworks.
- Keep inputs and outputs consistent.
- Favor deterministic preprocessing and stochastic reasoning to isolate agent behavior.
- Provide hooks to instrument internal states for analysis.

Data sources and preprocessing
- Price data: daily OHLCV from a public API or local CSV.
- Fundamentals: earnings, revenue, margins from a static dataset.
- Market context: index returns and sector performance.
- Preprocessing steps:
  - Fill missing values with forward-fill.
  - Align time windows to common date range.
  - Normalize values per stock for indicator calculations.
- Feature set:
  - Moving averages: 20, 50, 200 day.
  - Momentum: 14-day RSI.
  - Volatility: 30-day standard deviation.
  - Volume surge detection: volume / 20-day avg volume.
  - Trend strength: ADX 14.
- Save preprocessed features in a standard JSONL record for reproducibility.

Agent implementations
Each agent implements the same canonical API:

- init(config): configure model, tools, and parameters.
- run(ticker, horizon, context): produce a result object.
- explain(result): return a human-readable rationale.

A single test harness calls each agent with the same inputs and captures outputs.

CrewAI agent
- Design: CrewAI agent uses a modular set of workers. Each worker handles one step:
  - data_worker: fetch and validate data.
  - indicator_worker: compute indicators.
  - signal_worker: turn indicators into rules.
  - reasoning_worker: use an LLM to form the final recommendation.
- Memory: CrewAI uses short-lived state per job. The harness stores intermediate snapshots for debugging.
- Tools: CrewAI agent exposes tools for chart generation, backtest simulation, and external API queries.
- Implementation notes:
  - Workers exchange minimal JSON.
  - The reasoning worker receives a compact report: key indicators, aggregated signal, and a small context vector.
  - The LLM prompt emphasizes concise rationale and one-sentence final verdict.

LangGraph agent
- Design: LangGraph encodes the workflow as a graph. Nodes represent operations. Edges represent flows and dependencies.
  - Nodes: fetch_prices -> compute_indicators -> aggregate_signals -> llm_reasoner -> report.
- State: LangGraph keeps node-level caches. This speeds repeated runs during development.
- Tooling: LangGraph uses a chain of transforms and custom nodes for indicators and signal rules.
- Implementation notes:
  - Graph definitions are declarative.
  - The LLM node receives both structured data and a templated prompt.
  - The node returns a structured JSON so downstream nodes can parse fields.

AutoGen agent
- Design: AutoGen uses agent roles and tool wrappers. Roles include:
  - Analyst: reads data and forms observations.
  - Strategist: proposes a recommendation.
  - Arbiter: resolves conflicts and finalizes output.
- Memory: AutoGen keeps a conversation-like memory between roles for traceability.
- Tools: AutoGen uses a tool registry for charting, backtesting, and external lookups.
- Implementation notes:
  - Each role runs a tailored prompt with different system instructions.
  - The Arbiter collects role outputs and runs a deterministic tie-breaker.
  - AutoGen includes a reproducible seed system for response sampling.

Shared workflow across implementations
- The workflow runs in five logical steps:
  1. Data acquisition: pull price and fundamentals.
  2. Feature engineering: compute indicators.
  3. Signal rule aggregation: compute composite signal (range -1 to +1).
  4. LLM reasoning: generate a text rationale and final verdict.
  5. Packaging: wrap into JSON with diagnostics and provenance.
- Each agent must keep the signal aggregator identical. That isolates language-model effects.
- The signal aggregator uses a fixed weight vector to combine normalized indicators. The aggregator returns:
  - signal_score: float in [-1.0, +1.0]
  - signal_breakdown: per-indicator contribution.

Execution modes
The repo supports three modes. Each mode demonstrates an orchestration style.

Local single-thread
- Use this for local debugging and step-by-step tracing.
- The harness runs each agent sequentially.
- Captures logs and intermediate artifacts.

Parallel multi-agent
- Run all agents in parallel on separate processes.
- Use process isolation and persistent caches.
- Use the comparator to aggregate outputs and compute agreement.

Orchestrated pipeline
- Run an orchestrator that drives data flow and triggers each agent stage.
- The orchestrator manages retries and tool rate limits.
- Use this for production-like tests.

Evaluation metrics and test harness
- Agreement score: fraction of inputs where all three agents give the same recommendation.
- Precision per class: precision for BUY, SELL, HOLD aggregated across agents.
- Rationale alignment: semantic similarity between rationale texts measured by cosine similarity with sentence embeddings.
- Calibration: compare reported confidence to empirical accuracy.
- Latency: end-to-end runtime per agent.
- Debug traces: store agent tokens, prompt content, and tool calls for offline review.
- The harness exports CSV with raw outputs and metrics for plotting.

Reproducible experiments
- Use fixed seeds for model calls where supported.
- Use the same input dataset across runs.
- Store run metadata in run_manifest.json:
  - timestamp
  - dataset SHA256
  - model config
  - agent versions
  - seed
- Notebook examples load run_manifest.json and reproduce plots.

Benchmarks and sample results
- Example benchmark shows:
  - Agreement: 62% across a 6-month test set.
  - BUY precision: CrewAI 0.68, LangGraph 0.71, AutoGen 0.66.
  - SELL precision: CrewAI 0.58, LangGraph 0.61, AutoGen 0.57.
  - HOLD precision: CrewAI 0.75, LangGraph 0.73, AutoGen 0.78.
  - Median latency: CrewAI 1.4s, LangGraph 1.7s, AutoGen 1.9s (single-run local CPU proxy).
- Use the harness to run your own benchmarks. The repo includes sample csvs and a script to generate benchmarking plots.

Extending the project
- Add new agents
  - Implement the same API methods: init, run, explain.
  - Reuse the signal aggregator for parity.
  - Add a compatibility adapter if the framework dictates different input/output forms.
- Add new metrics
  - Implement a new scorer in metrics/scorers.py and wire it to the harness.
- Add new tools
  - Tools must follow a simple contract: tool(name, inputs) -> outputs JSON.
  - Register the tool in the agent config file to allow powered tools across frameworks.
- Swap LLM backends
  - Replace the model layer by implementing the small model adapter.
  - Preserve prompt templates to keep output format stable.

Running locally from source
- Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/JavierVasquez54/ai-agent-comparison.git
  cd ai-agent-comparison

- Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
  python -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  pip install -r requirements.txt

- Run the sample single-run:
  python scripts/run_single.py --ticker AAPL --horizon short

- Run all agents in parallel:
  python scripts/run_parallel.py --tickers AAPL MSFT GOOGL --horizon short

Configuration and environment
- Use .env to store API keys:
  - PRICE_API_KEY=your_key_here
- Basic config file: config.yaml
  - model: gpt-4o-mini
  - seed: 42
  - cache_dir: ./cache

Prompt and templates
- Prompt templates live under /templates.
- Keep templates short and structured.
- Rationale template includes a required short rationale section and a one-word final verdict field. The harness parses that field to map to BUY / SELL / HOLD.

Testing and validation
- Unit tests cover:
  - Signal aggregation logic.
  - JSON input/output parity.
  - Basic agent run that uses sample data and a stubbed model.
- Run tests:
  pytest -q

Diagnostics and logging
- Each run writes logs to ./runs/<timestamp>/logs.
- Logs include:
  - agent prompts
  - tool calls and outputs
  - timing information
- Use the comparator to inspect logs and compute error cases.

Comparator and analysis tools
- comparator.py reads run directories and builds a comparison report.
- The comparator exports:
  - metrics.csv (per-ticker metrics)
  - rationale_similarity.csv (pairwise similarity)
  - agreement_matrix.json (per-ticker agent decisions)
- Use the notebooks to load metrics.csv and generate plots.

Best practices for comparisons
- Fix the signal aggregator to isolate language effects.
- Keep prompts minimal and consistent across frameworks.
- Use identical tool outputs and stubs to avoid external variation.
- Record and publish run manifests for reproducibility.

Common pitfalls
- Mismatched signal scaling produces different numeric inputs to the LLM. Keep normalization identical.
- If one agent performs extra tool calls, the outputs may diverge. Use controlled tools or stubs to compare reasoning behavior.
- Token limits may truncate LLM context. Keep structured input compact.

Example outputs
- JSON example output from an agent:

  {
    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "horizon": "short",
    "recommendation": "BUY",
    "score": 0.72,
    "confidence": 0.83,
    "rationale": "Price sits above the 20- and 50-day moving averages. RSI sits near 55. Volume shows a 30% surge on positive earnings. Momentum favors upside with low volatility. Recommendation: BUY.",
    "signal_breakdown": {
      "sma_20": 0.2,
      "sma_50": 0.15,
      "rsi": 0.1,
      "volume_surge": 0.27
    },
    "diagnostics": {
      "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
      "prompt_tokens": 420,
      "completion_tokens": 130,
      "runtime_ms": 1450
    }
  }

Rationale similarity
- The repo uses sentence-transformers to compute cosine similarity between rationales.
- Similarity scores help measure whether agents reason similarly even if they disagree on recommendations.

Design trade-offs
- Deterministic aggregator vs. full LLM reasoning
  - Deterministic aggregator gives clearer numeric inputs to the LLM.
  - Pure LLM reasoning may find signals the aggregator misses.
  - The project uses a hybrid: deterministic aggregator plus LLM synthesis.
- Orchestration styles
  - Centralized orchestrator makes debugging easier.
  - Decentralized agents highlight framework strengths in coordination.

Security considerations
- Keep API keys in .env. Do not commit them.
- Sanitize inputs before calling external tools.
- Log prompts and outputs only to secure storage.

Performance tuning
- Cache price data locally to reduce API calls.
- Reuse model sessions to reduce cold-start latency if supported by the model client.
- Batch requests where possible.

Visualization and reporting
- Notebooks include:
  - per-ticker timeline plots of signals and recommendations.
  - agreement heatmaps.
  - rationale similarity histograms.
- Use the script scripts/generate_reports.py to create an HTML report for a run.

  System: You are an analyst. Provide a concise rationale and one-word final verdict.
  Input: JSON with signal_breakdown and context.
  Task: Return a JSON with keys: recommendation, rationale, confidence.
  Constraints:
    - Keep rationale under 40 words.
    - Provide a single-word recommendation: BUY, SELL, or HOLD.

- Example prompt filled:

  {
    "signal_breakdown": {"sma_20": 0.2, "sma_50": 0.15, "rsi": 0.1, "volume_surge": 0.27},
    "context": {"sector_trend": "positive", "index_return_30d": 0.02}
  }

Appendix B â€” Signal aggregator spec
- Inputs: normalized indicators in [-1, +1]
- Weights:
  - sma_20: 0.25
  - sma_50: 0.20
  - rsi: 0.15
  - volume_surge: 0.25
  - adx: 0.15
- Composite signal = sum(weight * indicator)
- Map composite signal to recommendation:
  - >= +0.25 => BUY
  - between -0.25 and +0.25 => HOLD
  - <= -0.25 => SELL

Appendix C â€” Running full benchmark
- Use the release asset or run from source.
- Example command to run benchmark across 100 tickers:
  python scripts/run_parallel.py --tickers-file data/tickers_100.txt --horizon medium --output runs/benchmark_$(date +%s)

- Run comparator:
  python scripts/comparator.py --run-dir runs/benchmark_<timestamp> --export plots/report_<timestamp>.html

Appendix D â€” Troubleshooting
- If model calls fail due to rate limits, set a lower concurrency in config.yaml.
- If indicators look off, verify data alignment and missing value strategy.
